# GlucoTrack: Predicting Diabetes Likelihood from Lifestyle and Clinical Data

## 🧠 Project Overview

GlucoTrack is a health-focused classification project that aims to predict whether an individual is diabetic, pre-diabetic, or non-diabetic using self-reported survey and biometric data. The dataset includes responses collected by the CDC on physical activity, BMI, mental health, general wellness, and other lifestyle variables.

The project is built around a real-world public health challenge: how do we identify individuals at risk before it’s too late? You’ll analyze patterns in health behavior and demographic variables to develop a predictive model that supports early interventions.

This project is split into two experience tracks:

* 🟢 **Beginner Track** – Build traditional classification models using scikit-learn and deploy a simple Streamlit app.
* 🔴 **Advanced Track** – Design and train a deep learning classifier with PyTorch or TensorFlow, integrate embeddings for categorical data, and deploy via Docker or Hugging Face Spaces.
